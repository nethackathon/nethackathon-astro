    <h2>Streamer Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <dl>
      <dt>How long is the time commitment if I sign up?</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>
          Most streamers will only be required to play NetHack and stream on Twitch for <strong>two hours</strong>
          during the event. You will only be assigned slots longer than two hours if required to fill gaps in the
          schedule.
        </p>
        <p>
          You will also need to allocate time before the event for set-up. See the
          <a href="/sign-up#/checklist">checklist</a> for more information.

      <dt>Do I need to be an expert NetHack player? I have never ascended before.</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>
          <strong>Not at all;</strong> past participants have had a wide variety of experience with NetHack. The only
          requirement is that you enjoy and can exhibit an enthusiasm for NetHack. We would like to show the audience
          that NetHack is enjoyable regardless if you are a newbie or a grizzled veteran.

      <dt>What about streaming? Do I need to be a seasoned Twitch streamer?</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>
          <strong>Many NetHackathon participants have never streamed before the event.</strong> You do not need to
          have a regular streaming schedule outside of the event (although we welcome experienced streamers as well).
          Some preparations, including a test stream, are required to make sure the event runs smoothly with the least
          amount of technical difficulties.

      <dt>I'm new to streaming, what are the technical requirements for streaming on Twitch?</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>
          You have to be able to play NetHack on a server, we use hardfought.org, and stream on Twitch using software
          like OBS. The requirements for playing NetHack on a server are very modest. To stream on Twitch, we suggest:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            A reliable Internet connection: to stream 720p video at 30 frames per second you will need a stable
            upload speed of 5Mbps.
          </li>
          <li>
            OBS runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux and requires a DirectX 10.1 compatible GPU for Windows or an
            OpenGL 3.3-compatible GPU for macOS and Linux.
          </li>
          <li>
            A modern CPU as fast or faster than an Intel i5 and 8GB of ram should allow you to stream 720p video
            at 30fps without issue.
          </li>
          <li>
            A microphone: either a headset, USB microphone, or an audio interface with an XLR microphone. If you
            want to participate but can't provide commentary for any reason, join the Discord and ask about
            co-hosting with another streamer.
          </li>
          <li>
            (Optionally) A webcam: many of our streamers use a webcam to show their face while participating but
            this is not required.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </dd>
      <dt>I have other questions that are not answered here or still have doubts about participating.</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>
          Join us on the <a href="https://discord.gg/PERAP8caeS">NetHackathon Discord</a> and introduce yourself. You
          can ask past participants about their experiences with the event. The community is very welcoming of new
          participants!
