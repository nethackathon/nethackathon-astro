    <h2>How do I connect to the server</h2>
    <p>
      You need to SSH into the server you've been assigned to, the servers are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>nethackathon.org (US)</li>
      <li>eu.nethackathon.org (EU/UK)</li>
      <li>au.nethackathon.org (AU)</li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      Cloudmillion recorded a video walk-through on connecting to the server in
      PuTTY and running the shared save:

    <h2>SSH? Never heard of it.</h2>
    <p>
      You'll need a SSH client, if you're on Windows, <a
        href="https://www.putty.org/">download PuTTY.</a
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      On Linux or Mac systems you can simply open a shell or Terminal window and
      type `ssh [your username]@nethackathon.org`.
    </p>

  <section class="a">
    <h2>OK, I'm connected to the server. Now what?</h2>
    <p>
      Type `nethackathon` and you'll be prompted to choose one of four default
      NetHack configurations.
    </p>
    <p>
      After you choose your configuration, it will launch NetHack with the
      shared save.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section class="a">
    <h2>
      When I type `nethackathon` it says "someone (some server) is currently
      running NetHack, ask them to save and quit."
    </h2>
    <p>
      The nethackathon script only allows one person to run NetHack at a time,
      ask the person listed to save and quit.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="a">
    <h2>But the person listed has already saved and quit / is me.</h2>
    <p>
      If you're on the same server as the last person to run the nethackathon
      script and NetHack is no longer running, type `rm /nethackathon/running`
      which will allow you to run `nethackathon` again.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you're on a different server than the last person to run the script,
      ask someone on that server to `rm /nethackaton/running`, run
      `nethackathon`, and save the game.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="a">
    <h2>How can I configure my NetHack settings?</h2>
    <p>
      After running `nethackathon` for the first time, your personal settings
      will be stored in a `.nethackrc` file in your home directory (where you
      start when you log into the server).
    </p>
    <p>
      You can edit the configuration file by typing, for instance, `nano
      .nethackrc`. When you're done editing type CTRL-X to exit and type `Y` and
      enter to confirm and save.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you already have a good configuration set up on a server like
      hardfought, browse for the location of your configuration file <a
        href="https://www.hardfought.org/nethack/userdata/">here</a
      >. Once you find the URL of your configuration file type the following in
      your home directory: `wget [url of your config] -O .nethackrc`.

    <h2>What's this I hear about a NetHack Twitch bot?</h2>
    <p>
      finitelycraig has programmed up a bot for us to use, just head to
      <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/oracleofdelphibot"
        >https://www.twitch.tv/oracleofdelphibot</a
      > and type !join in chat there. The bot then joins your channel.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may want to make oracleofdelphibot a mod for the usual reasons of
      message frequency and links. Now in your chat try typing !commands to see
      what the bot can do for you.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you want the bot to leave your chat type !oracle-depart in your chat
      (though it automatically disconnects from offline channels).
